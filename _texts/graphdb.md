## Note

For years software developers have been working with Relational Databases as
the only way to store production data at scale.  Then along came NoSql databases
as a way to store keys and values.  Although graph databases have been on the market
almost as long as relational databases, they never truly caught hold.  Now many different
forces are at work causing a resurgence of this "old concept."

## CHAPTER I

I was first introduced to Graph Theory back in my graduate school days in New Mexico.
At that time, a famous graph theorist named
[Frank Harary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Harary)
was finishing up his career as a professor emeritus in the deserts of the southwest.
During my years in grad school, I would talk to Frank and his graduate student all
about different forms of graphs.  Little did I know many years later the concepts behind
these ideas would lead to software products that could power the next generation of
storage and retrieval systems.
